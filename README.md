ðŸ‘‹ Welcome on my GitHub !

Currently immersed in an intensive programming pool. Passionate about, security and infrastructure, I am moving towards the DevSecOps field, 
where I want to combine my development and security skills to build secure, efficient and scalable production environments.


ðŸ“š Upcoming projects:

â€¢ Creation of a video game hosted on a website(expected by the end of 2024),
â€¢ Deployment and securing of applications in Kubernetes (expected in 2025),
â€¢ Cloud security studies and solutions (expected in 2025).

I am constantly looking for opportunities to learn and experiment in this exciting field.
Feel free to explore my repositories or contact me to discuss DevOps, security or new projects!
